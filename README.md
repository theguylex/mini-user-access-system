## A restaurant page created with CSS flex and grid properties


A section was created with a header and div elements in it then inside the div two input elements, a button and an empty paragraph element served as children elements to the div.

*First action carried out was the implementation of the hero  page and the restaurant banner just off the left margin, the nav and the creation of different menus implemented with divs having a number of child elements which contained headers, images, paragraph and button elements.

*Variables were declared for the role and age input ids. Checkaccess button was also selected and tagged with an event listener which calls a function "manageAccess" on click. The manageAccess function is implemented using conditionals with respect to "admin", "moderator", "guest" and "age" input values. An "accessIndicator" function with a parameter "text" is used to display corresponding text for the conditional statements in the manageAccess function.
